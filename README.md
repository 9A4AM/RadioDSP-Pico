# RadioDSP-Pico
Audio Filter DSP for Shorthwave Receiver
This Is a Digital Signal Processing to compute the audio of Shortwave Radio receiver. The project Is based on the Raspberry Pico pi board. The project implements some real time filters, show how to setup a simple real time processing dsp chain using the ADC and the PWM in/out for audio. All the works are in progress. 

[14.11.2022] updated priject and improved the filters
  Functions:
  1. Audio passthrough 
  2. SSB filter 3000 kHz + DNR low level
  3. CW  filter 800  Hz
  4. DNR High level

NOTE: The project was build with Arduino IDE v. 1.8.19 with the Arduino MBED OS RP2040 v.3.3.0 installed.
